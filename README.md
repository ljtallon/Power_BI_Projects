# World Energy Consumption Dashboard (Power BI)

A data visualization project analyzing global energy consumption trends.  
This dashboard transforms the same **World Energy Consumption dataset** used in one of my SQL projects into an interactive **Power BI report**—turning raw queries into actionable insights.

## Project Overview  

This project demonstrates how SQL-based data analysis can be translated into an interactive visualization using Power BI.  
- **Tools:** SQL, Power BI
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, ETL, dashboard design, exploratory analysis  
- **My Role:** Built SQL queries to prepare the dataset, designed Power BI visuals, and highlighted key global energy insights.  

## Key Contributions  

- Extracted, cleaned, and transformed raw global energy consumption data using SQL queries.  
- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters for region, year, and energy type.  
- Visualized energy types and consumption trends across multiple decades.  
- Delivered insights on which energy sources are growing, declining, or shifting geographically.

## Takeaways
- Sweden has the lowest carbon emissions, at 14.43%.
- Qatar uses the most energy per capita, at $194,221.
- China leads the primary energy consumption per population, followed by the United States, then India.
- Oil is by far the most consumed energy type each year from 2000-2022.

# Data Survey Dashboard (Power BI)

A data visualization project transforming raw survey data into an interactive Power BI dashboard that reveals key workforce trends and insights.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to clean and transform raw survey data, design calculated measures, and build a dynamic dashboard in Power BI.  

- **Tools:** Power BI, DAX, Excel  
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, interactive visualization  
- **My Role:** Processed raw data, created calculated columns using specialized formulas, and designed the interactive dashboard with charts.  

## Key Contributions
- Processed raw survey data by:
  - Handling missing/null values.  
  - Standardizing multi-response variables for accurate aggregation.  
  - Creating calculated columns to enrich analysis.  
- Built an **interactive dashboard** with slicers, charts, and KPIs to uncover workforce trends.  
- Designed visual narratives to make complex survey data accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## Takeaways
- Data scientists earn the highest salary, with an average of $93,000.
- Python is the preferred coding language.
- Most data professionals found it difficult to break into this industry.
